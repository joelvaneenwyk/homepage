Finally made the switch to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) after battling with my hand-crafted website for too long. Final straw was that there were just too many out-of-date dependencies which caused everything to break in small and subtle ways. My options were to either spend a lot of time fixing that site or start from scratch. The former option would mean being stuck with hand-crafted garbage that would inevitably break again or switch to something that would last a bit longer (hopefully) and be a bit more battle-tested.
