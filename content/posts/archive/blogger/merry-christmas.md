Hope you all had a great Christmas!!! I certainly did! Got to eat lots of delicious food, did lots of talking with my family, and even opened some presents! Also, an old friend of mine came over and hung out for a while...knew him since I was like 6 years old, so it was cool to finally do some catching up with him. Alright, I must return to the festivities. :)

Best wishes and a Merry Christmas to all!
