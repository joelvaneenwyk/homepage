Finally, all exams are finished and the winter break can be enjoyed! Last Friday I finished my last exam, and right after I packed my bag and prepared for the flight to China, which left early the next morning. So, after a very long day of flights and only minor delays, I arrived at my destination...it was around 10:30PM on Sunday (local time). At that point, I was completely exhausted and crashed immediately, and for the first time in months, I got over ten hours of sleep! So today, after waking up, I spent most of the time with my family--just talking and catching up on what has been going on in our lives.

So now begins my winter break, and the start of some progress on my projects!
