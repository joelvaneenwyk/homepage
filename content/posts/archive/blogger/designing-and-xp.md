Classes started out today really slow...seemed as though it would never end. But once they were done, and I returned home, I began work on the my philosophy paper. The goal is to write a paper regarding Calgary University's class "Computer Viruses and Malware". It essentially teaches people how to write viruses in order to teach them how to write more secure software. This is pretty old news (2003), but it is still quite an interesting topic. If anyone has any thoughts on the topic, please let me know...I'd be interested to hear what you think.

After I was finished with all of that, I moved on to more of my own projects. As I mentioned before, Agents went through some growing pains, and so I've split everything up and have been reworking some of the individual parts. Today, I wanted to test out some pair programming (XP style), so my brother and I sat down and discussed the best approach to creating a DAG system for agents...something more flexible than my previous implementation. Well, we actually spent more than 3 hours on it, and have something that I really like. It's by no means complete, but it's a great start. In fact, it worked out so well, that I would really like to do that again sometime. Teaming up with someone that knows as much as you is great, because it allows you to bounce ideas off each other and anticipate potential problems. If you're not familiar with XP, go [here](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/). Well worth looking into.
