Started the day off with some good coffee, worked some, and then at lunch time went to a friend's house to spend Thanksgiving. There were quite a few people as much of his family was there. The food was great--turkey, stuffing, cranberry salad, rolls, and so much more! It's good to have friends who can cook. ;)

Afterwards, we played some poker and ended the day with a trip to the theater to watch Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Must say that I really enjoyed that one...they're getting so much darker now, and I like that. Now I'm back, and utterly exhausted.

Hope you all had a great Thanksgiving!
