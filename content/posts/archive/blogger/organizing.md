Not much programming was done today. Had to get some stuff reorganized for some of my upcoming projects (like the Material Editor). I have some custom controls that I created for Agents, and I would like to use those same controls for the Material Editor. So today I spent some time separating various components in Agents into separate libraries so that I could resuse them. Should've done that in the first place, but better late than never. Today wasn't all that fun...hopefully I'll have some more interesting news tomorrow.
