News of Autodesk buying Alias was somewhat surprising to me. Although Autodesk is larger than Alias, were the sale reversed, I wouldn't be very shocked. What does this mean for consumers and developers? From reading their [FAQ](http://images.autodesk.com/adsk/files/Autodesk_Alias_External_FAQ.pdf), I'm guessing there won't be any major changes (much like with Alias' purchase of Kaydara). It's really hard to say, though. I'm really hoping there won't be any major changes, because I can't help thinking Autodesk would mess it up. The purchase just doesn't seem like that good of a business move, but I'm going to withhold judgement until more information is released about it.

Not much other news, just very busy with my projects as usual. Anyway, here's a random clip to entertain you: [Framestore Commercial](http://www.framestore-cfc.com/press/05pr/051003noitulove/amv_gune339_050_qt.mov)
