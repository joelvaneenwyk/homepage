# Dev Notes (Oct 22, 2017)

Traveling is always my most productive time for random thoughts and coding exercises. Doesn't always mean clean code in fact it basically never does, but I always have a list of topics I'd like to explore and then when on a plane I finally have time to do that. This time I tackled a few topics:

* SQLite-net
* Reveal.js
* Browser extensions (webpack, TypeScript)

## Reveal.js

For work, I create presentations using PowerPoint quite a bit. It's intuitive to use and makes it very easy to slap a presentation together, but it does have some limits.

Some goals:

* Have a presentation that runs standalone. Do NOT want it running in a browser.

### Standalone

To solve this problem, there turns out to be a good solution: [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/about/). Alternative is [NWJS.io](https://nwjs.io/)

## SQLite

As with a lot of tech exploration the big problem is too much information. Finally found a decent [tutorial](https://github.com/praeclarum/sqlite-net/wiki/GettingStarted) that made this straightforward.

## Browser Extensions

This was really tricky mostly.
