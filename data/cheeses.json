It is known in English as 'Finnish squeaky cheese'. Other dialects have various names such as narskujuusto that depict the way that fresh leip\u00e4juusto \"squeaks\" against the teeth when bitten. Among all its synonyms, leip\u00e4juusto is the more commonly known name.\r\n         \n\r\n          Leip\u00e4juusto is a fresh cheese made from cow's beestings, rich milk from a cow that has recently calved. It can be made also from reindeer or even goat's milk. The cheese is called 'Leip\u00e4juusto' (bread cheese) or 'Juustoleipa' (cheese bread) since it is 'toasted' during its preparation. The oven cheese contains about 20 to 22% milk fat while today's lighter versions contain about 12% milk fat.\r\n         \n\r\n          Traditionally, people used to let leip\u00e4juusto get totally dried so that they could then store it for up to several years. For eating, they used to heat the almost rock hard Leip\u00e4juusto cheese on a fire to soften it and to produce appetizing aroma. Even today, the cheese is dried by keeping it in a well ventilated area for a few days. But, unlike its older version, it has a mild flavour.",

Dating back to the Byzantine era, the cheese is believed to be the ancestor of most hard Greek cheeses.\r\n         \n\r\n          Young cheeses are aged for a minimum of two to three months whereas aged Kefalotyri can be a year old or more with a dry, stronger flavour.\r\n         \n\n\r\n          Kefalotyri tastes similar to Gruyere; however it is harder and saltier. The cheese is consumed as is or added to a wide variety of pasta, meat and cooked vegetable dishes. It is also traditionally served fried in strips or cubes for a dish called Saganaki. This cheese is especially suited for grating atop sauces, pizza, stews and salads. Ideal for cheeseboards, the tangy cheese is served with fresh seasonal fruit, such as pears, figs and grapes alongside red wine and sausages.",

While Labneh is classified as a cheese, it retains the distinctive sour flavour of yoghurt. It forms a traditional and important ingredient of Middle Eastern and south Asian cuisine. The procedure of making Labneh is same as strained yoghurt, that of boiling off some of the water content, adding salt, butterfat and powdered milk. Eaten both cooked and raw, it is used in savoury sauces as it does not curdle at high temperatures, unlike normal yoghurt, due to its high fat content. It is used as dip for bread, added to stew, and to add creaminess to soups. Also used as a sandwich spread. The cheese has to be consumed within a week of its preparation. Nowadays this cheese is also available in low fat variety.",

Made from pasteurised full cream cow\u2019s milk in spring-fall season, the cheese takes 3-4 weeks to fully mature.\r\n         \n\r\n          The highlight of the cheese is that it is regularly washed with Chablis, a local high-status white wine until the maturing process is over. This bath in wine slowly makes its impact on the yellow-organish ferments inside the cheese. As it nears maturity, the cheese glows of a deep copper pigmentation to reveal the richness of burgundian soils.\r\n         \n\r\n          Once the cheese is removed from the wooden box, it turns extremely creamy and velvety. The texture is dense covered by a soft, moist, orange rind. The mild, savory flavour perfectly sets off the strong, aromatic smell of the cheese. It goes well with sweet and acidic fruits. It augments the flavour of dry white wines like Chardonnay and of course Chablis.",

        "summary": "'Afuega\u2019l Pitu' is one of the oldest Spanish cheeses. It is also famous as one of the most widespread Asturian cheeses.\r\n         \n\r\n          The cheese is produced from cow's full fat milk in towns that dot the lower basins of river Narcea and\u00a0river Nal\u00f3n in the central Asturias-Northern Spain. It is made by curdling in a mould at a temperature of between 20 and 25 degrees, for 10 to 48 hours. During its preparation, animal rennet is added and its interior or rind may also be salted.\r\n         \n\r\n          The cheese comes in different types that are recognized by its form/shape, the ingredients added and the aging period. And hence, each type is known with a particular name. The type that resembles the shape of a bishop's miter or inverted flowerpot is called 'Troncado/Atronc\u00e1u' (Trunk). If the cheese block is round and resembles a shape of cloth bag, then it is called 'Trapo/Trapu' (Rag/Cloth). Moreover, if paprika (red chilli or bell pepper powder) is added while making the cheese or the cheese is rolled in paprika taking its red colour, then it is called 'Roxu/Rojo'. This type of Afuega\u2019L Pitu has very strong, spicy flavour as it is always eaten when matured. It is tasted as a \"tapa\" or dessert, generally accompanied by bread. If the cheese is made without adding paprika, then it remains white in colour, and so, is called as 'Blanco/Blancu'. This variety of Afuega\u2019L Pitu has soft, white, light, sticky rind which is usually moldy. In addition to these types, the length for which the cheese has been aged also defines its varieties such as Cured, Semi-cured or Soft.\r\n         \n\r\n          Though this cheese is produced all year round, the best type is the one made during spring and winter as the fat content of the milk is at its highest during these seasons!\r\n         \n\r\n          Afuega\u2019l Pitu is eaten either when fresh and slightly aired or once matured after several weeks in a fresh, damp, well-ventilated atmosphere.\r\n         \n\r\n          The name 'Afuega\u2019l Pitu' is derived from the \"bable\" Asturian dialect. It means 'choking cake' because its unusual texture makes\u00a0 the cheese stick to the taster's palate and pharynx. The name 'Afuega\u2019l Pitu' also symbolizes one of the Spanish legendary custom\u00a0\u2018drowning the rooster\u2019 refering to cheese producers feeding a piece of the freshly made cheese to a rooster.",

If truth be told, it is one of the most popular cheeses in the world, accounting for 50 to 60 percent of the world's cheese consumption. There are several types of Gouda, classified by age. From all of these, hard-core Gouda fans prefer to taste the aged Gouda, as they feel it takes years of maturing to bring out the complex flavours of the cheese.\r\n         \n\r\n          Aged Gouda is prepared similar to other Gouda cheeses by separating curds and whey through a heating process. It is shaped into a wheel that can be effectively sliced into wedged for consumption. As with all other cheeses, aged Gouda gets its colour by adding colouring agent called annatto. With aging, Gouda develops calcium lactate crystals formed by the lactic acid in the cheese. It proffers an enjoyable crunch that is unique to waxed cheeses. However, the rind of a five-year aged Gouda is unfit for human consumption.\r\n         \n\n\n\n\r\n            Gouda affinage\r\n           \n\n\n\r\n          The longer a cheese is kept in maturation cellars, the more aromatic and full-flavoured it becomes. Similarly, Aged Gouda such as a five-year aged cheese develops such strong flavour that cheese aficionados prefer to eat it alone. Accompaniments seem pale in comparison to its caramel and robust flavour.\r\n         \n\r\n          Gouda cheese as a hard cheese goes well with beer and red wines. The taste of Vintage or Aged Gouda gets a new definition when it is paired with some white wines and any fruity wine.",

The cheese is ripened for six to nine months on pine boards, until it develops a strong and spicy alpine cheese flavour. During the maturation process, the cheese loaf is brushed and turned daily by hand on the Alpe with brine.\r\n          \n\r\n          This celebrated cheese has won many international awards including gold and bronze at World Cheese Awards 2014.",

In 2002 it was separated from the Fourme de Montbrison, an identical cheese, to receive an individual AOC status.\r\n         \n\r\n          The cheese is a traditional, farmhouse blue cheese that can be either co-operative or artisanal. Fourme d'Ambert is more supple and dense than most blues. Milk from cows grazing on either lower or higher mountain pastures is used to produce the cheese. Although, the cheese matures in 40 days, it is cave-aged for two-three months for optimum quality. During the aging time, it is injected with Vouvray moelleux, a sweet white wine. It is easily recognizable by its unusually tall cylindrical shape.\r\n         \n\r\n          The p\u00e2t\u00e9 is cream coloured with prominent blue veining. The cheese is inoculated with Penicillium roqueforti spores for the growth of blue veins. Slightly tangy, savory flavour infused by the bacteria, beautiful complements the distinct notes of butter and cream.\r\n         \n\r\n          Wine connoisseurs can enjoy the cheese with Sauternes and other dessert wines as well as full bodied reds such as Rhone\u2019s, Pinot Noirs and Syrah.

In case of string cheese, the curds are worked into elastic strips, which are then plaited or twisted. This creates fibres of cheese that can be pulled away in strings.

Asiago d\u2019allevo is matured for different time periods; Mezzano for 4-6 months, Vecchio for more than ten months and Stravecchio for two years.
