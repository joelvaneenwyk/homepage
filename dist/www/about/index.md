# About


{{< figure class="avatar" src="/images/avatar.jpg" title="Picture of Joel Van Eenwyk" >}}

âš  ðŸš§ This is a work in progress.

You have landed on my page it seems. My interests are all over the place but you will see some commonality in my love for low-level coding, graphics, emulation, and DevOps type work. Finding clean, reproducible, processes that make it easier for groups of people to iterate on code and innovate gets me pretty excited.

Currently working on cross-platform provisioning scripts built with Docker, Ansible, and many other tried and true tools.
