# Good food!


First two days here have been awesome! Already been out to eat twice to get genuine chinese food...oh how I've been missing it!! Also did some last-minute Christmas shopping, which was fun. All in all the last few days have been quite relaxing, and it's something I've really needed as this last semester has been somewhat stressful for me.

Tomorrow I'm going to get back to work. There are quite a lot of things on my agenda, so some planning is in order first. No matter what...it'll be fun! :)
