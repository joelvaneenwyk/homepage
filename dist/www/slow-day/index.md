# Slow day

There's always those days that just seem to drag on and on...well, today was just one of those days. Nothing seemed to go well. On the bright side, I did get an animating mesh, but it should not have taken as long as it did...too many other things came up today. Tomorrow is thanksgiving day, so I'll be going to a friend's house for part of the day. Hopefully I'll be back in time to get some work done, but if not, all is good. I think I still have enough time to fulfill my deadline.

Well, that's going to be it for today. No cool links or anything. :) Going to get an early rest and wake up early. Everyone have a happy thanksgiving!
