# Music and Houdini


Mondays...always a bit slower than the rest of the week. Got some good programming done on the engine. Then switched over to my website a bit. Got some Flash working and the design is a lot more the way I want it. Will hopefully have something to show soon.

Finally got Evergrey's album The Inner Circle...it rocks! Highly recommend it, so go buy it and listen to it...now!

And here's an image I sketched a few minutes ago:
