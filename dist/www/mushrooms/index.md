# Mushrooms?


Managed to get LUA and TCL implemented nicely into the engine now. The next step is to add all the necessary functions for communicating with the engine. This will be a LOT easier now that I'm using [LuaBind](http://luabind.sourceforge.net/). I've now set a few new deadlines for myself since I have a more organized schedule put together. Should be by the middle of next month I'm going to start sending it out to people for testing. It's going to be very primitive when I do start the testing, but better to start early than wait too long and be stuck with a bad design...it's one thing for me to like and quite another for users to like it. Since I already had gotten a long way in the first design, I have a lot of code to reference, which is making things go a lot faster.

Let's see...the link for today is for those who fancy trance, techno, and all that...in fact, those that do like that type of music probably already know about it, but here you go anyway: [Digitally Imported.](http://www.di.fm/)

Another thing...found an interesting application today called [Anark Gameface](http://www.anark.com/solutions/solutions_game_ui.asp), which allows you to create game interfaces inside their custom application, and then export that out to XML, which you then implement into your own game engine via their SDK. It all seems very well done, and I'd really like to be able to test this out as the idea seems solid. Creating a really good interface for a game is not an easy task and being able to take that chore away from the programmer and place it on the artist entirely is an excellent idea. I've struggled with it, and I've read about and talked to many programmers (like the Thief 3 guys) who have also spent far too much time on it...this product may actually turn out to be a really good idea!
