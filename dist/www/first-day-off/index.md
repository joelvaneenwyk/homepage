# First day off


Having Monday "off" was great! Got up fairly early and started jamming away at programming. The weird messaging errors I was getting yesterday have been fixed, so I've moved on to getting the 3D viewport back into operation with manipulators and the whole bit. Should be just a matter of copying and pasting the code from before. My new goal is to have a walking character controlled by a simple brain by next week.

Alright, off to bed so that I can be prepared for (in announcer voice):

DAY 2 -- Programming Madness!
