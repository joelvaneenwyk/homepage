# Eye candy!!


First off, everyone who hasn't yet seen the new Harry Potter trailer MUST go see it: [Trailer](http://movies.aol.com/movie_exclusive_harry_potter_goblet_clip/trailer_extra_large). Looks like it's going to be another awesome movie! Sure it may not be better than the book, but that's to be expected. :)

Today I got the 12th issue of [Stash](http://www.stashmedia.tv/)!!! When I was at Siggraph, I signed up for a free issue and they actually sent it!! IT IS AWESOME!!! If I had a bit more money, I'd definitely get a subscription. Each issue comes with a DVD and a booklet. The DVD has music videos, shorts, commercials, and all sorts of clips...all of which look great. Watching that actually "wasted" almost two hours of my day today.

Alright, none of my programmer news is going to top those two things, so I'll just post more tomorrow. :)
