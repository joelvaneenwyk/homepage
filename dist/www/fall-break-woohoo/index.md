# Fall break!!!  Woohoo!


Today has been great! No class or homework to distract me, so I got to really focus on programming and designing my engine. The interface between the widgets, graphics engine, and the scene graph is now almost complete...everything is communicating nicely. Need to create an API for creating plug-ins, and then it will be mostly complete. The interface for creating new Nodes is quite clean and was inspired mostly by Maya and Houdini (as well as some XSI). All of those have really nice APIs IMO, but they all have inherent flaws, which I'm hoping to have overcome. This is not to say that the architecture is complete, but it is very far along now...you could say it has entered alpha stages.

Yesterday (or the day before?), I created a quick Python script to generate visual studio project files for the HDK (Houdini) sample files. Never really used Python a lot in the past, but it really shined for doing this, which probably means I'll be using Python more frequently in the future...or perhaps Ruby, as it is also a really good language, but I chose Python only because I've had more experience with it.

Well, that's it for today. Hope that all who have Fall break continue to enjoy it!
