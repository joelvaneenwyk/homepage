# Graphics Engine, Houdini, and DOPs

Computer is back and operational today! Got to do some more with the engine today. Almost done with the Overlay system for drawing text and all that. Also added in some more logging code, so that I can track down errors more easily.

Finally spent some time with Houdini and DOPs (Dynamic Operators) today...been wanting to do that since Siggraph. First impressions with it have been really good. Relatively easy to set up and manage, and the flexibilty you get is really nice. It's incredibly easy to transfer the simulated data between the other operators and manipulate it as you wish. I'll be doing some more tests this week and might just throw up some test renders as well.

Hope everyone had a great weekend!
