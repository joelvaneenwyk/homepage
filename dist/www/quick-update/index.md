# Quick update

Sorry for the complete lack of updates after promising them. Things suddenly got very crazy again. Next week I have my finals and then I'm done!! On Saturday of next week (17th), I fly back to China where I'll be spending an entire month. Will be great! :) Very excited to be done with another semester.

Anyways, this is just a short update, but after finals are over, I'll definitely be back to regular updates.
