# Weekend


Life has been quite busy these last few days...classes, tests, homework, and my freelance projects...lots going on. This week I have two tests, so I have lots of studying to do.

On another note, Agents is going through some growing pains. It's got to the point where there was too much code and it needed to be split up a bit more. So, I've been doing that over the last few days. Not the most exciting thing to do, but it'll be very worth it in the end.

Been doing more work with Houdini these last few days and putting serious thought into my demo reel. I've done a lot over the last few years, but never compiled the work together. So figured it was about time.

The weekend was crazy and I didn't update my blog at all, but things should be back to normal now....hopefully.
