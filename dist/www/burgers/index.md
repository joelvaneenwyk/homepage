Today was chilly. Actually, the days have just been getting progressively colder. Wait a minute, it is winter after all so I suppose that makes sense...yeah.

I'm starting to get really excited about my project(s)! There is an end in sight! Can't believe the semester is almost over already. Kept thinking it was going to be done sooner, but I can see why it hasn't. The time has definitely not been a waste, though, as I've learned a lot over the last few months. May not have as much to show for it, but that comes next. ;)

I only have one class this next week!!!! This is going to be great...a whole week that I can devote to work and to desperately attempting at reaching a pleasant state of serenity (translation: relaxing).

For those who celebrate thanksgiving, start getting ready for it! The best way to do that is go out, buy a turkey, set up some candles around it, and worship the turkey and its utter awesomeness. For the turkey allows us to reach culinary nirvana...praise be the turkey god!
