# The great Houdini...magic...yeah


Got back on Houdini this evening as I now have the footage necessary to complete the shot. Should have some sample shots done this week. The footage is pretty clean...only a little cleanup and wire-removal necessary. This is going to be the first project in which I've heavily used COPs, so this should be an interesting experience...hopefully a positive one. I've done lots of tests with COPs in the past, but it's when you really do a full-blown project that you get to see it perform. I do have pretty high expectations, though, as the main compositing package I've had experience with is Shake. Will let you all know how it handles my abuse. :)  
  
Made excellent progress on Agents today as well. Did some more documentation work outlining some of the processes that Agents must be able to form, which I'll use as a guide for how to progress. Integrated all the major functions that control the engine over to LUA commands, which was EXTREMELY easy. LuaBind is a godsend...if you ever plan to integrate a scripting language into an application, please PLEASE consider using a boost wrapper. It will make your life a lot easier. Anyways, with some of the major commands now in place, I'll be moving on to adding toolbar buttons and such that utilize those commands to bring the interface to life.  
  
Alright, that's all for today. Got a test in geology tomorrow, so I better get to bed. Bye all!
