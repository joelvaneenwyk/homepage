# More madness


Not much to report. Had a geology test tonight. It wasn't easy, but I think I did alright on it. The prof. said that if you managed to get every problem wrong, you would get 100% on the exam. Sounds easy, but with multiple choice tests you really have to know what's going on to purposefully answer every one wrong. I didn't try it this time, but if my grade for the class is really high at the end of the semester I might give it a try. :)  
  
Alright, that's gonna be all for today.
