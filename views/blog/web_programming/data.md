# Introduction

As a C++ programmer by profession, every few years I look into the web and scoff at it. The tools are usually nowhere near the robustness.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

There are innumerable other technologies I looked at while implementing my website that I haven't even started to have time to look at. You can add unfurl tags (http://tinyurl.com/pu59bre) via oEmbed server or HTML meta tags for Facebook OpenGraph.

For live editing you have StackEdit and Prose.io and numerous others which all seem pretty great, but honestly if you're using GitHub then you can use your favorite desktop app like Sublime in my case.

Cloudpipes is another that caught my eye, but spending money to visually program automated interactions with the world seems a bit strange to me.
