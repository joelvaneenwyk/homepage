# Introduction

As a C++ programmer by profession, every few years I look into the web and scoff at it. The tools are usually nowhere near the robustness I'm used to and the level of control I have is just not the same. As a type-safe programmer, Javascript upsets me and the likes of jQuery scare me.

But over time I've come to realize that this is in great part due to my fear of the unknown. Yes, there are parts of web programming that are truly terrible (TODO: insert reference), but it's really coming around. TypeScript exists for those of us that like some degree of type safety. NodeJS for Visual Studio is great and debugging works beautifully. And we have tools like Grunt for code cleanup and the closest thing I can find to a compile step to help keep me in check for doing tool builds.

# Custom Domains


# Other Technology

There are innumerable other technologies I looked at while implementing my website that I haven't even started to have time to look at. You can add unfurl tags (http://tinyurl.com/pu59bre) via oEmbed server or HTML meta tags for Facebook OpenGraph.

For live editing you have StackEdit and Prose.io and numerous others which all seem pretty great, but honestly if you're using GitHub then you can use your favorite desktop app like Sublime in my case.

Cloudpipes is another that caught my eye, but spending money to visually program automated interactions with the world seems a bit strange to me.
