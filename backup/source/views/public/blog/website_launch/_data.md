# Website Launched!

This website has been in the works for quite some time now, but finally pushing it out to the world. It is nice to have a place to store my experiments and thoughts, but in great part this website is here as a testing ground for me to play with web technologies. I'm a console game programmer by trade, but it's always interesting to play with the new hotness. Usually that isn't in the web world but hey, it's all interesting to me.

The website lives on Heroku and the source is all available on GitHub. My plan/hope is to post more about this in the coming weeks/months, but who knows. Primarily I want to do this for myself so that I don't forget how to do this. If you observe my code submit patterns you'll notice they are all over the place because I travel quite a bit and stop working on things for myself.
