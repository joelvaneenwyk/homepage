This bath in wine slowly makes its impact on the yellow-organish ferments inside the cheese. As it nears maturity, the cheese glows of a deep copper pigmentation to reveal the richness of burgundian soils.\r\n         \n\r\n          Once the cheese is removed from the wooden box, it turns extremely creamy and velvety. The texture is dense covered by a soft, moist, orange rind. The mild, savory flavour perfectly sets off the strong, aromatic smell of the cheese. It goes well with sweet and acidic fruits. It augments the flavour of dry white wines like Chardonnay and of course Chablis.",

        "summary": "'Afuega\u2019l Pitu' is one of the oldest Spanish cheeses. It is also famous as one of the most widespread Asturian cheeses.\r\n         \n\r\n          The cheese is produced from cow's full fat milk in towns that dot the lower basins of river Narcea and\u00a0river Nal\u00f3n in the central Asturias-Northern Spain. It is made by curdling in a mould at a temperature of between 20 and 25 degrees, for 10 to 48 hours. During its preparation, animal rennet is added and its interior or rind may also be salted.\r\n         \n\r\n          The cheese comes in different types that are recognized by its form/shape, the ingredients added and the aging period. And hence, each type is known with a particular name. The type that resembles the shape of a bishop's miter or inverted flowerpot is called 'Troncado/Atronc\u00e1u' (Trunk). If the cheese block is round and resembles a shape of cloth bag, then it is called 'Trapo/Trapu' (Rag/Cloth). Moreover, if paprika (red chilli or bell pepper powder) is added while making the cheese or the cheese is rolled in paprika taking its red colour, then it is called 'Roxu/Rojo'. This type of Afuega\u2019L Pitu has very strong, spicy flavour as it is always eaten when matured. It is tasted as a \"tapa\" or dessert, generally accompanied by bread. If the cheese is made without adding paprika, then it remains white in colour, and so, is called as 'Blanco/Blancu'. This variety of Afuega\u2019L Pitu has soft, white, light, sticky rind which is usually moldy. In addition to these types, the length for which the cheese has been aged also defines its varieties such as Cured, Semi-cured or Soft.\r\n         \n\r\n          Though this cheese is produced all year round, the best type is the one made during spring and winter as the fat content of the milk is at its highest during these seasons!\r\n         \n\r\n          Afuega\u2019l Pitu is eaten either when fresh and slightly aired or once matured after several weeks in a fresh, damp, well-ventilated atmosphere.\r\n         \n\r\n          The name 'Afuega\u2019l Pitu' is derived from the \"bable\" Asturian dialect. It means 'choking cake' because its unusual texture makes\u00a0 the cheese stick to the taster's palate and pharynx. The name 'Afuega\u2019l Pitu' also symbolizes one of the Spanish legendary custom\u00a0\u2018drowning the rooster\u2019 refering to cheese producers feeding a piece of the freshly made cheese to a rooster.",

If truth be told, it is one of the most popular cheeses in the world, accounting for 50 to 60 percent of the world's cheese consumption. There are several types of Gouda, classified by age. From all of these, hard-core Gouda fans prefer to taste the aged Gouda, as they feel it takes years of maturing to bring out the complex flavours of the cheese.\r\n         \n\r\n          Aged Gouda is prepared similar to other Gouda cheeses by separating curds and whey through a heating process. It is shaped into a wheel that can be effectively sliced into wedged for consumption. As with all other cheeses, aged Gouda gets its colour by adding colouring agent called annatto. With aging, Gouda develops calcium lactate crystals formed by the lactic acid in the cheese. It proffers an enjoyable crunch that is unique to waxed cheeses. However, the rind of a five-year aged Gouda is unfit for human consumption.\r\n         \n\n\n\n\r\n            Gouda affinage\r\n           \n\n\n\r\n          The longer a cheese is kept in maturation cellars, the more aromatic and full-flavoured it becomes. Similarly, Aged Gouda such as a five-year aged cheese develops such strong flavour that cheese aficionados prefer to eat it alone. Accompaniments seem pale in comparison to its caramel and robust flavour.\r\n         \n\r\n          Gouda cheese as a hard cheese goes well with beer and red wines. The taste of Vintage or Aged Gouda gets a new definition when it is paired with some white wines and any fruity wine.",

In 2002 it was separated from the Fourme de Montbrison, an identical cheese, to receive an individual AOC status.\r\n         \n\r\n          The cheese is a traditional, farmhouse blue cheese that can be either co-operative or artisanal. Fourme d'Ambert is more supple and dense than most blues. Milk from cows grazing on either lower or higher mountain pastures is used to produce the cheese. Although, the cheese matures in 40 days, it is cave-aged for two-three months for optimum quality. During the aging time, it is injected with Vouvray moelleux, a sweet white wine. It is easily recognizable by its unusually tall cylindrical shape.\r\n         \n\r\n          The p\u00e2t\u00e9 is cream coloured with prominent blue veining. The cheese is inoculated with Penicillium roqueforti spores for the growth of blue veins. Slightly tangy, savory flavour infused by the bacteria, beautiful complements the distinct notes of butter and cream.\r\n         \n\r\n          Wine connoisseurs can enjoy the cheese with Sauternes and other dessert wines as well as full bodied reds such as Rhone\u2019s, Pinot Noirs and Syrah.

Selected by Will Studd, the cheese has a mellow, salty and tangy flavour while the texture is springy. After grilling the cheese, it forms a brown crust due to high fat sheep's milk and elastic texture due to goat's milk.

Most of the cheeses cannot be peeled because of the way they are processed. The curds are pressed into blocks resulting, the cheese either crumbles or breaks apart. In case of string cheese, the curds are worked into elastic strips, which are then plaited or twisted. This creates fibres of cheese that can be pulled away in strings. Cow, sheep, and goat milk can be used in the preparation of string cheese. It is popular with children as it is an excellent source of protein and calcium.\r\n         \n\r\n          In Middle East countries of Armenia and Syria, traditional string cheese is prepared from goat or sheep\u2019s milk. In some places, it is made from 100% whole cow's milk. The cheese is flavoured with various spices including black cumin, nigella seeds and a unique Middle Eastern spice known as mahleb. The cheese is available in an indefinite plaited loop. In Syria, string cheese is known by its Arabic name \u2018jibneh mshallaleh\u2019. Middle Eastern string cheese goes well with Lebanese bread and licorice flavoured Greek liqueur, Ouzo.\r\n         \n\r\n          The flavour of Middle Eastern string cheese varies from velvety, buttery to a sharp, tangy one. Texturally, it is firm and flexible besides giving a thread feeling in the mouth. Many people associate Mozzarella with string cheese as it can be plucked apart in logs.",

As it ages further, the soft & sticky cheese develops blue and gray moulds on and under the leaves, leading to a strong and intense flavour.\u00a0 The casing of leaves protects the washed-rind disc and allows the young, slightly acidic cheese to remain moist.

It is first aged in cellars for one or two months before it is wrapped in foil and aged for an additional month.

The rind is fluffy, white, smooth and mushroomy like a Brie or Camembert while the inside is delicate, creamy with a slight salty flavour and a mild relish. The paste is lightly dotted with blue moulds but the taste of the cheese is very mild. Softer than normal blue cheeses, this Alexis de Portneuf version matures in about 2 weeks and has around 37% fat.\r\n          \n\r\n          The origin of Bleubry is attributed to the Italians who combined Gorgonzola with Mascarpone to make a cake. The temperate flavour with only a hint of pungency is perfect for those who are learning to appreciate blue cheeses.\r\n          \n\r\n          The delicate flavour of the cheese reveals its richness with a good port or red wine, served at room temperature. Bleubry has won innumerous awards including 2014 silver medal at the World Championship Cheese Contest, 2010 bronze medal at the World Cheese Awards and 2010 3rd prize in its category at the British Empire Cheese Show.",

When he returned back, he discovered that the mold covering the bread had transformed it into a blue cheese.\r\n         \n\r\n          Blue cheese is also identified by a peculiar smell that comes from the cultivated bacteria. The flavour of the cheese depends on the type of blue cheese, shape, size, climate of the curing and the length of ageing. But it generally tends to be sharp and salty.

These monks continued to make the cheese until the dissolution of their monasteries in 1540. Traditionally, sheep\u2019s milk was used, but over the time cow\u2019s milk was also used. The art of making the cheese was passed by the monks to the farmer\u2019s wives who produced a blue variety of Wensleydale at their farmhouses. Today, Wensleydale is produced mainly from pasteurised cow\u2019s milk with sheep\u2019s milk added to enhance the flavour. Wensleydale Creamery in the town of Hawes is seeking to protect the name Yorkshire Wensleydale Cheese under PDO designation. But there are other producers of Wenslydale cheese in parts of the UK, mainly in Shropshire and Cheshire.\r\n         \n\n\r\n           Blue Wensleydale\r\n          \r\n          is a handcrafted cheese made exclusively by Wensleydale Dairy Products in the town of Hawes. It was invented by Thomas Nuttall in the late 19th century. The recipe is a variation of the famous Stilton cheese but more firmer. It is matured for six months and lightly pressed for only 24 hours before being wrapped in muslin cloth. The mellow and less salty Blue Wensleydale appeals to many newcomers and cheese connoisseurs alike.",

Evidence in the chronicles of Charlemagne suggests the tasting of Brie by the Emperor in the year 774. It is also said, Louis XVI last wish was a tasting of Brie cheese. In 1814, the European Tournament at Congress of Vienna, awarded Brie de Meaux the \"Le Roi des Fromages\" (The King of Cheeses) for its unarguable flavour and texture.\r\n         \n\r\n          Brie de Meaux, an AOC cheese should be matured in the regions of Seine-et-Marne, Loiret, Aube, Marne, Haut-Marne, Meuse and Yonne. The difference between production and maturation places is a typical Brie tradition.\r\n         \n\r\n          This is a raw, soft unpasteurised cow's milk cheese covered with a bloomy rind, a result of inoculation with Penicillium Candidum molds. As the cheese ages, the rind develops red or brown patches. When nearly half of the straw coloured pate is ripe and soft, it indicates Brie de Meaux is ready for consumption.\r\n         \n\r\n          Brie has a milk and rich taste underlined by sweet and buttery flavours of mushrooms or truffles and almonds. The cheese pairs perfectly with Champagne, a red Bordeaux or Bourgogne (Burgundy).",

It was granted an AOC protection in 1980 that requires that the cheese be manufactured under strict guidelines for supreme quality.\r\n         \n\r\n          Brie de Melun is produced from either whole or skimmed, raw milk of cows grazing in the valleys of Seine et Marne and some departments of Aube and Yonne. It is semi-soft cheese inoculated with a Penicillium mold and aged in a cellar for at least 4-5 weeks. If the cheese is left to ripen for a longer period, say several months then it matures to a Brie Noir. Since, Brie de Melun is coagulated with lactic acid as opposed to animal rennet it is a vegetarian cheese.\r\n         \n\r\n          It is an aromatic cheese with slightly musty and straw-like smells floating the air. Over-ripening the Brie can result in an unpleasant odor from bacteria that are used to ripen the mould. The texture is semi-soft and the rind slightly dry. As the cheese matures to a Brie Noir, the rind turns darker and crumbly. In addition, the pate is drier and darker and the flavour stronger to taste. The usual flavours are strongly lactic and slightly salty finished by soft, barnyard, sour notes. Brie de Melun is used to prepare regional dishes like cro\u00fbte au brie. It pairs well with Gaillac and wines from Burgundy or the Rhone Valley.",

Some variants are often kept for up to a year to develop a harder texture and stronger taste. Inside the pale ivory rind of the cheese, young Caerphilly has a fresh and pleasant taste alongside a moist yet supple texture. With maturity, the edges become creamy and the flavour becomes more rounded. It usually has a wheel-shape with ivory-white rind dusted with fine flour. As the cheese ages in a moist cellar, the white and gray moulds become thicker and more leathery. The cheese can be vegetarian depending upon the brand.\r\n         \n\r\n          A basic white burgundy would go well with this cheese. It is normally grated or melted onto dishes.",

The climate, soil, pasture, cattle stock, and milk quality separate out superior Canadian Cheddar from the regulars. Unlike other cheddars, Canadian cheddars have a smoother, creamier texture as well proffer the right balance of flavour and sharpness. Depending on their age, the flavour, texture and aroma of a cheddar cheese can vary.\r\n         \n\r\n          Cheddar is traditionally creamy white in colour but due to the addition of tasteless food colouring, it often appears dyed in an orange hue. The cheese can be made from raw, pasteurised or thermalized milk to retain more of the flavour-enhancing enzymes. Even if cow\u2019s milk is the most commonly used source for making the cheese, it is not uncommon to find Canadian cheddar made from sheep or goat's milk. Cheddar ripens from inside out and is classified depending on its aging time.\r\n         \n\r\n          In Canada, cheddar is produced almost entirely by a number of large companies in Ontario including limited artisanal producers. Of these, the most prize winning cheddar maker in all Canada, is the Balderson Cheese Company. The cheese is aged for a minimum of three months and maximum up to six years for optimal supreme quality. Flavoured cheddar cheese spiced up with some popular flavours, made in Canada include cranberry, dill, flax, garlic, jalapeno, olive and sun-dried tomato. Some of the common types of Canadian Cheddars are Lancashire, Double Gloucester, Wensleydale, Leicester, Derby, Cheshire, Cantal, Caerphilly and Colby.\r\n         \n\r\n          Mild and Medium Cheddars are ideal for snacking and with lighter foods like omelets, sandwiches and as garnish. Old Cheddar can be used for shredding, slicing and pairs well with white wines and pale ales/lager. Extra Old Cheddar compliments white wines, red wines & rose wines.

Even though it is very difficult to produce this cheese, the low lactose content has a digestive advantage when preparing various dishes requiring less lactose. The cheese is used in cakes, dips, appetizers, savory meat and various vegetable preparations. Its creamy taste creates an exciting pairing with red wine.\r\n         \n\r\n          Since the Mauritanians don\u2019t eat much cheese, the EU has not implemented regulation policies for dromedary camel products.

Cheeses made with raw milk such as Castigliano have a spicy, cream-caramel, buttery flavour that is perfectly offset by the fresh acidity and hint of salt. The fruity tang of the table cheese when served with the classic Spanish quince or membrilla, takes the dish to a completely new level.

The recipe for Cerney was created by Lady Angus of Gloucestershire in 1983, inspired by Valencay cheese from the Loire valley.\r\n         \n\r\n          The cheese is shaped like a truncated pyramid coated with oak ash/sea salt mix. It takes 3 days to make the cheese and has a shelf life of approximately four weeks. When 1 or 2 weeks old, Cerney has a soft mousse like texture and a fresh mild flavour. The cheese develops deeper flavour as it ages. The shape and production of Cerney is very similar to Valencay, but the taste is very different with less of a goat flavour. The cheese is available in many different varieties including peppermix rolled, brandy washed and fresh rounds intended for grilling.\r\n         \n\r\n          Cerney Pyramid has been consistently awarded gold, silver & bronze medals at the World Cheese Awards.

It is a hard and natural cheese that has a slightly crumbly texture if properly cured and if it is too young, the texture is smooth. It gets a sharper taste as it matures, over a period of time between 9 to 24 months. Shaped like a drum, 15 inches in diameter, Cheddar cheese is natural rind bound in cloth while its colour generally ranges from white to pale yellow. However, some Cheddars may have a manually added yellow-orange colour.\r\n         \n\r\n          Joseph Harding, the \"father of Cheddar cheese\" who invented modern cheese making techniques described the ideal quality of original Somerset Cheddar as \"close and firm in texture, mellow in character or quality, rich with a tendency to melt in the mouth and has full and fine flavour somewhat like hazelnut!\"",

Only a few cheeses are aged beyond four months and they cannot be frozen without loss of quality. Considering the availability of limited milk production, experiments are on to make cheeses from frozen goat milk curd.\r\n         \n\r\n          The flavour and aroma of goat cheese relies upon its moisture, density, aging and flavouring.

The maturation which lasts for 3-4 weeks results in a fine and smooth paste and a yellowish-orange rind that is moist and tainted with moulds. As with other chevre cheese, it has the odor of goats and flowers with a nearly sweet taste. Being a mountain cheese, it has an inherited aromatic sourness suggestive of wild herbs fed to the goats. Chevrotin des Aravis pairs well with Cotes du Rhone, Bandol, Mondeuse, Chignin-bergeron, Saint-joseph and Savoie wines.",

While the cheese looks similar Cheddar due to the colour, Colby cheese is softer, has a more open texture and higher moisture content. The flavour is much milder and creamy if compared to Cheddar. It does not undergo the \u201ccheddaring\u201d process but is instead manufactured with a washed curd process that reduces the acid content making the cheese less tangy.\r\n         \n\r\n          An aged Colby becomes cracked and dry and therefore the cheese is to be eaten as young as possible.\u00a0Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Shiraz wines pair well with the American cheese. The gentle flavour and texture of Colby gives a new definition to grilled sandwiches, hamburgers, fajitas, chili, rye bread or apples and pears. To accentuate the flavour it is sometimes blended with other cheeses such as Monterey Jack, to make\r\n          \r\n           Colby Jack\r\n          \r\n          cheese.",

The unpasteurised cow's milk used is mainly from Montbeliarde Cattle or French simmental (or cross breeds of the two). This hard mountain cheese is matured to perfection in the silence and darkness of special caves where the cheese gets its unique taste, texture and colour. There are several maturing cellars in the region where Comt\u00e9 is ripened for a minimum of 4 months to 18 or 24 months. A few times, Comt\u00e9 gets its name from the cellar where it has ripened such as Comt\u00e9 Fort Saint-Antoine.\r\n         \n\r\n          Comt\u00e9 was one of the first few cheeses to receive an AOC (Appellation d'origine controlee) status in 1958. It is one of the most popular AOC cheeses in France with around 40,000 tones of annual production.\r\n         \n\r\n          Considered one of the finest cheeses in the world, a wedge of Comte reveals a pale yellow interior and a texture that can vary from silky, flabby to crystalline.\r\n         \n\r\n          There are practically 83 flavours, which can be savored while tasting Comt\u00e9. But the main aromatic flavours that delicately linger on the palate are a balance of brown-butter and roasted-nut aromas and a sweet finish.\r\n         \n\r\n          Its ability to melt easily means Comt\u00e9 goes well with many recipes right from fondues to Croque Monsieur. The cheese pairs well with Rhone reds, a Palo Cortado or off-dry Amontillado sherry from Spain.\r\n         \n\r\n          Fromageries Arnaud, the winner of Super Gold medal at the 2014 World Cheese Awards, is one of the top-notch groups in the world to make French certified-origin cheeses.

The leaves impart a gentle garlicky flavour on the finish and their moisture gives the cheese a slightly firm texture. This cheese goes through a slightly longer maturation process than the Cornish Yarg since the leaves are well-known for their medicinal and anti-bacterial properties. It also helps to slow down the process of mold development giving the rich and creamy cheese, a hint of garlic at the finish. The cheese is sold still wrapped in the leaves, under which the natural rind of the cheese is dotted with natural white, grey and pink moulds. The pale yellow cheese beneath the edible crust is creamy under its natural rind and slightly crumbly in the core.\r\n          \n\n\r\n           This artisan cheese is a silver medal winner at the 2014 World Cheese awards.",

Cornish Yarg adopts the Wensleydale style recipe but differs in many ways from a traditional Wensleydale. The hand-made cheese is wrapped in stinging nettle leaves, brined for 18 hours, then dried for 2 days and allowed to age for about 6 weeks before being sold in the market. The cheese is sold still wrapped in the leaves, under which the natural rind of the cheese is green with grey, white or green mould. The pale yellow cheese beneath the crust is creamy under its natural rind and slightly crumbly in the core. The crust is edible. The cheese has a slightly delicate, creamy lemony flavour with hints of mushroom. A variant, wrapped in wild garlic leaves is also available.\r\n         \n\r\n          The tangy taste of the cheese goes well with a Domaine Du Grand Chemin, Burgundy or Mature Red Bordeaux.\r\n         \n\r\n          This artisan cheese is a celebrated gold medal winner at the 2014 World Cheese awards.",

Protected with DOP law, it becomes an extraordinary by its content of vitamins and proteins and also by its calcium and phosphorus rich nature. After the maturation period of natural ageing, its paste offers an extraordinary healthful power with soft and velveteen nature. This cheese is known as \"new\" when it has passed the current year, said to be \"mature\" when it has completed a period of 12 - 18 months. It is called as \"old\" when it reaches a period of 18 - 24 months and \"ultra old\" when it is aged for 24 - 36 months. The quality of each and every cheese is examined by eight factors namely age, maturing degree, fragrance, structure, paste colour, consistency, rind condition and dappling. The shape of cheese is checked by the \"threshing\" and \"dowelling\" processes with the help of specific tools such as the percussion hammer, the screw needle, the plug or probe.

As the cheese ages Dry Jack wheels become increasingly brittle. As the cheese is similar in texture to Parmesan, it makes a good substitute for churning and grating over salads, pasta, soups or tacos. The cheese can be shred, cooked, sliced or even eaten as it is. You will never go wrong by grating Dry Jack over casseroles, toasted cheese sandwiches, omelets and souffl\u00e9s.

These monks continued to make the cheese until the dissolution of their monasteries in 1540. Traditionally, sheep\u2019s milk was used, but over the time cow\u2019s milk was also used. The art of making the cheese was passed by the monks to the farmer\u2019s wives who produced a blue variety of Wensleydale at their farmhouses. Today, Wensleydale is produced mainly from pasteurised cow\u2019s milk with sheep\u2019s milk added to enhance the flavour. Wensleydale Creamery in the town of Hawes is seeking to protect the name Yorkshire Wensleydale Cheese under PDO designation. But there are other producers of Wenslydale cheese in parts of the UK, mainly in Shropshire and Cheshire.\r\n         \n\n\r\n           Extra Mature Wensleydale\r\n          \r\n          , matured for nine months is the strongest Wensleydale produced by Wensleydale Creamery.

Now-a-days, many stores sell goat and cow\u2019s milk feta as well. The firmness, texture and flavour differ from region to region, but in general, cheese from Macedonia and Thrace is mild, softer and creamier, less salty with fewer holes.

The cheese can be used a table cheese or melted on a traditional Greek salad, spanakopita, pizza or pie. It tastes delicious with olive oil, roasted red peppers and nuts.

There are many Fontina cheeses made with alternative names such as \"Fontinella\", \"Fontal\", and \"Fontella\" but the Italian Fontina, Fontina Val d'Aosta, identified by a Consorzio (Consortium) stamp is the original and most famous. The other versions are much milder than the original Fontina. There is also a Danish version which can be recognized by the red wax rind. Italian Fontina has a natural rind that turns tan to orange-brown with aging.\r\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n          Fontina Val d'Aosta is traditionally made from unpasteurised milk of the Valdaostan Red Spotted cows grazing on the plains of Aosta Valley. The texture and flavour of Fontina depends on how long it has been aged. The texture can vary from semi-soft to firm and the flavours from mild and rich to more robust and overpowering. Usually, fontina is aged for 90 days.\r\n         \n\r\n          The interior of fontina is pale cream in colour and riddled with holes known as \"eyes\". With a fat content of 45%, the cheese is very rich and creamy which gets nuttier with aging. This versatile cheese can be used to make fondues, and similar Italian dishes.

This old method was first discovered by Normandy tribes 2000 years ago. The crusty, washed rind has orange and yellow moulds. Flavour of wild and herbs growing on the local mountains are reflected in the cheese. Affinage takes at least two months and it has a fat content of 48 per cent.

A major difference with this cheese and Brie fall into the cheese making process. Fromage D'Affinois is produced using ultra-filtration, a process that separates the water from pasteurized milk, concentrating all of the other components. This makes the cheese making process much faster than the process of a typical Brie and creates a much creamier and silkier texture. Many people consider it a triple-cr\u00e8me based on its flavor and consistency, although the fat content technically make is a double-cr\u00e8me.

On the other hand, Single Gloucester uses full cream milk from the morning milking and skimmed milk from the evening milking.\r\n          \n\r\n          Single Gloucester has a P.D.O designation, meaning it can be produced only in Gloucestershire. There are only four cheese makers in Gloucestershire who make Single Gloucester.

Also, it is lighter in texture, crumbly and low on fat.\r\n          \n\r\n          The double variety has a smooth and buttery texture, rich and nutty yet mellow flavour and apricot colour thanks to the addition of annatto plant extract.

It is a semi-hard cheese celebrated for its rich, unique flavour and smooth texture. The original cheese markets in Gouda is one of the last standing commercial cheese markets in the Netherlands. Since the name is not protected, it has become a generic classification for all cheeses produced and sold under the name Gouda.\r\n         \n\r\n          Gouda is typically made from pasteurised cow\u2019s milk although some artisan varieties use sheep\u2019s or goat\u2019s milk to produce cheeses that are going to be aged for a long time. Boerenkaas is a typical variety of unpasteurised Gouda cheese produced by the farmers from milk of cow's grazing on the natural, low pastures of Netherlands. There are seven different types of Gouda cheese, categorized depending on age. Graskaas is young Gouda ready to be consumed within weeks of production. On the other hand, is the extra aged, Overjarig cheese which has a full-flavoured, hard, golden interior and salty flavour reminiscent of a toffee. Between the spectrums is a variety of Dutch Gouda\u2019s classified as per the texture and age - Jong, Jong belegen, Belegen, Extra belegen, and Oud. Each cheese gets increasingly firmer in texture and richer in flavour than earlier classification. The waxed rind of the cheese also changes by the age as soft, younger Dutch Gouda cheese are identified by yellow, orange, or red wax rinds white mature cheese have black wax coverings.\r\n         \n\n\n\n\r\n            Stacked Gouda Wheels\r\n           \n\r\n          In America, smoother and less flavourful commercial Gouda is popular than Dutch Gouda. Artisans in Netherlands may produce Dutch Gouda using raw milk as well as pasteurised.\u00a0 To enhance the flavour of the cheese, herbs, seasonings, and nuts may be blended. In Netherlands, aged Gouda is commonly used to richen soups, sauces.\r\n         \n\r\n          Young Goudas are best paired with beer while medium cheeses taste best when paired with a fruity Riesling or Chenin Blanc. A well aged Gouda complements wines that are deeply flavoured such as a rich Merlot or Shiraz. Gouda cheese may be grated, sliced, cubed or melted. It may be used as a table cheese or dessert cheese.\r\n         \n\r\n          Gouda is available in large wheels with each weighing between 10 and 25 pounds.",

As it matures, the bouncy and soft cheese develops notes of mushrooms, nuts, bog and forest floor. Extra maturity allows the rind culture to move through the pasture and allow it to build up a full-bodied, rich and savory taste.\r\n         \n\r\n          Gubbeen is excellent with burnt onions, grilled cheese and pairs well with aromatic whites and beer.",

In addition, they make sure the cheese making process starts in mid-April when the grasses feed the cows better and the milk supply is sufficient.\r\n          \n\r\n          Havilah is a dense cheese with a beautiful, earthy black rind made from a layer of ash beneath which lies a dense, yellowish pate. Slightly pungent, this mouth-watering dense cheese reveals fruity tones of pineapple, citrus, and caramel. It is perfect for grating or meting on dishes such as pastas or crisps. If Havilah is aged beyond 16 months, it begins to develop granules giving the cheese a wonderful texture.",

Named after the village of Idiazabal, the cheese received Spanish D.O. (Denominacion de Origen) in 1987.\r\n          \n\r\n          In summer, the sheep migrate to higher pastures to graze on the blossoming, new grass. During this time, the artisanal cheese makers milk the sheep, make the cheese and leave it in the rafters to mature for a minimum ripening of 2 months. At the end of summer when the cheese makers return back to the lowlands with their sheep, the cheese has ripened and is ready for sale.\r\n          \n\r\n          Idiazabal is produced in the shape of a cylinder, with a smooth and hard natural rind that is pale yellow to amber in colour. The cheese has a compact texture, with a few pinprick holes. It is dry, but not crumbly, and feels pleasantly oily in the mouth. The rind carries the marks of the wooden moulds in which it was drained. The characteristic, smoky flavour is the result of the cheeses having been stored near the fireplaces. There were no chimneys in the simple mountain huts, so the cheeses absorbed the sweet, aromatic smoke. The taste of the cheese is reminiscent of burnt caramel and bacon.

While Labneh is classified as a cheese, it retains the distinctive sour flavour of yoghurt. It forms a traditional and important ingredient of Middle Eastern and south Asian cuisine. The procedure of making Labneh is same as strained yoghurt, that of boiling off some of the water content, adding salt, butterfat and powdered milk. Eaten both cooked and raw, it is used in savoury sauces as it does not curdle at high temperatures, unlike normal yoghurt, due to its high fat content. It is used as dip for bread, added to stew, and to add creaminess to soups. Also used as a sandwich spread. The cheese has to be consumed within a week of its preparation. Nowadays this cheese is also available in low fat variety.",

One gets daily and seasonal variation in terms of both flavour and texture but all-in-all the cheese has both cheddar and gruyere-like qualities. It has a smooth texture and a strong taste. In summer, notes of pineapple, toasted nuts and grassy dominate the flavour profile while in winter the taste becomes savory and almost meaty. Lincolnshire Poacher pairs well with full bodied reds and whites and beer.\r\n         \n\r\n          The company makes many other traditional cheeses such as Vintage Lincolnshire Poacher aged for 18 to 22 months, Smoked Lincolnshire Poacher, Double Barrel and Lincolnshire Red which is made using vegetarian rennet.",

The milk is sourced from the Majorera goat that primarily feed on marjoram and formed into cylindrical shapes. This cheese ranges from a soft and supple pate to a more firm and dense texture. When the cheese is younger, it has a milky and goaty flavor. As it ages, the flavor becomes more assertive and nutty. This cheese must be aged for at least 8-20 days but typically the more aged versions are the only ones allowed in the United States. This cheese can come without any coating on the rind, with pimenton (a type of paprika), or with gofio (roasted corn flower).",

The art of making the cheese was passed by the monks to the farmer\u2019s wives who produced a blue variety of Wensleydale at their farmhouses. Today, Wensleydale is produced mainly from pasteurised cow\u2019s milk with sheep\u2019s milk added to enhance the flavour. Wensleydale Creamery in the town of Hawes is seeking to protect the name Yorkshire Wensleydale Cheese under PDO designation.

In fact, this cheese is produced by the same process of Dutch Edam.\u00a0 There are many arguments as to where this cheese was originally produced. Some argue that Mimolette originated in Holland whereas others insist it was founded in France. During the reign of Louis XIV, it was illegal in France to import cheeses from Holland. One theory is that the French from Normandy developed this cheese as a result to their cultural ties to Holland. The cheese is bright orange in color with a natural, dusty looking rind. Its texture varies from firm to hard the flavor most closely resembles the sharp and tangy flavors of a well-aged cheddar. The cheese also carries the name \u201cBoule de Lille\u201d since the cheese originates from the town of Lille. This cheese is classified into four different categories based on its aging time: 1) Mimolette Jeune (aged 2 months) 2) Mimolette demi-vielle (aged 6 months) 3) Mimolette vielle (aged 12 months) 4) Mimolette tres vielle (aged 18-24 months)",

It is a soft, wet cheese made from raw cow milk and can be ripened or unripened depending on its variation. The tradition of making Minas cheese is more than 300 years old. In May 2008, the original firm, ripened Minas cheese was declared a Brazilian Immaterial Cultural Heritage by IPHAN, the Brazilian Immaterial Cultural Heritage by IPHAN, the Brazilian Institute for National Historic and Artistic Heritage.\r\n         \n\r\n          The time left to ripen Minas cheese can vary from as little as 4 -10 days, which results in queijos-de-minas frescal cheese. It has a spongy texture, with lots of air bubbles inside with a mild yet quite salty taste. The saltiness will vary according to the region and producer. This is not a good cooking cheese but can be used to make sandwiches, pastries and cr\u00eapes. The texture tends to become slightly rubbery rather than stringy with heat. It pairs well with turkey breast and other low fat cold cuts, cooked strong-tasting vegetables and salads.\r\n         \n\r\n          If left to mature for around 1-5 weeks, the soft unripened variety develops into partly-cured Minas cheese (queijo minas meia-cura). The fully-cured variety of Minas cheese called queijo minas curado is ready when juicy softness has evaporated and it acquires a yellowish tint. Curado cheese has a white core, pricked with tiny bubbles of air, slightly more granulated than frescal and with a more stronger taste, deviating to bitter. It is excellent for cooking, being used in a huge variety of dishes, particularly the famous p\u00e3o de queijo (cheese bun). One of the most popular desserts in Brazil is a sweet dish called\u00a0goiabada prepared with Minas cheese and guavas.

It has been observed that those cheeses made from buffalo milk are higher in calcium, protein and lower in cholesterol than cow's milk. Mozzarella di bufala is manufactured under strict regulations in areas ranging from Rome in Lazio to Paestum, Campania and a production area near Foggia, Puglia. Buffalo mozzarella coming from the Campania region bears the \"Mozzarella di Bufala Campana\" trademark and DOC status granted in 1993. In 2008, the European Union granted Mozzarella di Bufala Campana a Protected Geographical Status. Apart from Italy, it is also produced in many countries.\r\n         \n\r\n          Buffalo mozzarella is a fresh, soft, semi-elastic textured cheese belonging to \"pasta filata\" family. The process of making pasta filata cheese includes heating the curd to a point where it can be stretched and formed into various shapes. This gives the snowy white mozzarella a mild yet slightly sour taste. The texture is soft, moist and somewhat granular. It is coated with a thin edible rind and brined for up to a week when sold in vacuum-sealed packages.\r\n         \n\r\n          The cheese goes well in antipasti dishes, with salads, pastas, calzones, vegetables and various side dishes. It is also common in popular Italian dishes like lasagne and baked casserole. When used in cooking, heated mozzarella becomes slightly creamy. Buffalo mozzarella pairs with Beaujolais, Sauvignon Blanc and White.",

The soft and creamy cheese also comes flavoured with cumin and tastes best when accompanied with a good beer. As with washed rind cheeses, Munster have a red coating on the rind that is slightly humid due to repeated washings. Other than protecting the cheese, the rind is also responsible for a strong, penetrating aroma and tangy taste.\r\n         \n\r\n          The best Munster cheeses are produced in the summer and autumn when the cows graze on the 'high stubble' of the Vosges. This cheese has a very high fat content of 45-50%. Gewurztraminer or full-bodied red wines nicely complement Munster. If you're a potato and cheese lover try Munster with potatoes, salad and finely chopped onions.",

In Alsace, on the eastern side of the mountains it is called Munster. In Lorraine, on the western side of the mountain it is known as Gerome. Munster received its AOC certification in 1969 but in 1978, the AOC Munster-Gerome united the two cheeses. This cheese has absolutely no resemblance to the generic, American version of the cheese Muenster. The French version is a very highly aromatic cheese with a sticky, red colored rind. The pate is smooth and creamy the cheeses full and rich flavor is attributed to the baryardy, grassy, and herbaceous aroma generated from the brine rubbed rind. The milk used to make Munster comes from the Vosgiennes cows, a breed that was imported from Scandinavia in the 18th century.",

These monks continued to make the cheese until the dissolution of their monasteries in 1540. Traditionally, sheep\u2019s milk was used, but over the time cow\u2019s milk was also used. The art of making the cheese was passed by the monks to the farmer\u2019s wives who produced a blue variety of Wensleydale at their farmhouses. Today, Wensleydale is produced mainly from pasteurised cow\u2019s milk with sheep\u2019s milk added to enhance the flavour. Wensleydale Creamery in the town of Hawes is seeking to protect the name Yorkshire Wensleydale Cheese under PDO designation. But there are other producers of Wenslydale cheese in parts of the UK, mainly in Shropshire and Cheshire.\r\n         \n\n\r\n           Oak Smoked Wensleydale\r\n          \r\n          is naturally smoked for 18 hours using oak chips at the Wensleydale Creamery dairy to generate a subtle, smoked flavour along with a firmer and stronger texture. The cheese is a variant of Real Yorkshire Wensleydale as it maintains the same characteristics while adopting an attractive golden beech colour.\r\n         \n\r\n          Wensleydale goes well with fruit cake, apple and is a perfect accompaniment during lunchtime or tea time. It also tastes delicious with hot desserts like fruit pies and crumbles. It is the king of cheeseboard where its fresh, milky sweetness and robust flavours rule the roost. It complements fruity white wine such as Pinot Grigio.",

This cheese unites two regions of France in the Western Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es: Ossau in the valley of the Bearn and Iraty in the beech forests of the Pays Basque. It received an AOC protection in 1980, which requires that the cheese be produced with the milk of only two breeds of ewes - Manech and Basco-B\u00e9arnaise.\r\n         \n\r\n          An uncooked and pressed cheese, Ossau-Iraty is semi-hard in texture with a thick, buff rind marked with rust and gray molds. Beneath the brown and orange rind is an ivory white, supple and slightly grainy interior that has a creamy and buttery mouth feel. Flavours are herbaceous, nutty and fruity if the produce is from winter while the summer cheeses tend to reveal aromas of grass and flowers.\r\n         \n\r\n          Matured for at least 6 months, Ossau-Iraty often comes in a flat cylindrical shape. There are three main sizes available, small (Petit-Ossau-Iraty-Brebis Pyrenes), intermediate (non-fermier) and large (fermier). It is sometimes dusted with paprika leaves to add a kick of flavour. It tastes delicious with fruity red, full-bodied red or white wines such as Zinfandel, Tempranillo or Syrah.",

The cheese is made in the style of pasta filata, and generally weights between 1.5 and 2.5 kg.

However, in the recent times the cheese is produced only in the regions of the province of Matera.\r\n         \n\r\n          The rind of the cheese is straw-coloured, smooth and hard. It becomes browner as it ages, and turns golden when the cheese gets fully matured. It needs to be aged for at least twelve months before it reaches maturity. The process of making this cheese starts with warming and curdling with rennet and then they are placed in a tompagno, which is a perforated basket. After some hours the sets are sliced up and \u2018spun\u2019 in hot water. The portions of cheese are then moulded manually, and after salting in brine for 12 to 20 hours, they are allowed to dry.\r\n         \n\r\n          In 2009 the comune of Gravina made an application for the cheese to receive PDO status within the European Union.",

It is a hard, DOC, cows milk cheese named after the town of Parma and produced in the provinces of Parma, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna, and Mantua. The milk used is unpasteurized, and comes from free-range cows. The milk is left overnight so that the cream can be skimmed off the next day and added with the fresh morning milk, making it a partially skim mixture. The texture of Parmigiano Reggiano is hard and grainy and its flavors are rich, nutty, and sweet with undertones of salt. It is a very versatile cheese as it commonly used as a grating cheese in the United States but primarily a table cheese in Europe. As with all aged cheeses, Parmigiano Reggiano intensifies in flavor and dry out as the cheese ages longer. There are three categories of ripeness for this cheese: 1) \"Fresco\" - Aged between 12 and 18 months 2) \"Vecchio\" - Aged between 18 and 24 months 3) \"Stravecchio\" - Aged between 24 and 36 months There are many imitations of this Parmigiano Reggiano, such as Parmesan (found in the United States and usually pre-grated with higher salt content) and Reggianito (manufactured in Argentina and much younger and milder).",

Beneath the thin rind, the pate varies from light to dark yellow depending on age. The texture alters from dry to flaky with the addition of pleasant graininess. It offers a characteristic flavour derived by rubbing the cheese with olive oil and ash, before it\u2019s left for maturing. The flavour of younger wheels reveals quite a bit of saltiness along with a distinct savoury and aromatic herbal taste. As the cheese matures, the savoury flavour and tanginess become stronger. Pa\u0161ki sir tastes best when served with fresh fruits such as grapes,\r\n          \r\n           prosciutto, wildflower honey or olive oil.",

It covers a wide variety of cheeses produced around the country, but specifically it refers to four main varieties of Pecorino, all of which enjoy PDO protection. These hard ewes\u2019 milk cheeses from central Italy and the island of Sardinia have established a very good export market outside Italy.\r\n         \n\r\n          Of these four,\r\n          \r\n           Pecorino Romano\r\n          \r\n          from Sardinia, Lazio and Tuscan Province of Grosseto is the most widely known outside of Italy. The remaining three mature PDO cheeses are Pecorino Sardo from Sardinia, Pecorino Siciliano from Sicily and Pecorino Toscano from Tuscany.\r\n         \n\r\n          Pecorinos are traditional, creamery, hard, drum-shaped cheeses. They come in a variety of flavours determined by their age. Aged Pecorinos referred to as \u2018stagionato\u2019 are hard and crumbly in texture with buttery and nutty flavours. Young or \u2018semi-stagionato\u2019 and \u2018fresco\u2019 Pecorinos feature a softer texture with mild, creamy flavours. A good Pecorino will have smooth, hard rind that is pale straw to dark brown in colour. The rind will vary in colour, depending on the age of the cheese, and may include a protecting coating of lard or oil. Its compact interior is white to pale yellow in colour, with irregular, small eyes.\r\n         \n\r\n          Today, this classic Italian cheese is available in many flavours including Pecorino Pepato spiced with black peppercorns or red chili. Pecorino is a preferred cheese in many pasta cheeses and an obvious choice in Italian regions where the cheese is produced. Also, it served as a good substitute for the expensive Parmigiano-Reggiano.",

Of the four Pecorino cheeses that have received Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status under European Union law, Pecorino Romano is one of the most ancient types of cheese as well as the most famous outside of Italy. As per legislation, production of Pecorino Romano is allowed only on the islands of Sardinia, Lazio and in the Tuscan Province of Grosseto. All these varieties differ from each other, depending on how much they have aged.\r\n         \n\r\n          As the name suggests, the history of Pecorino Romano dates back to the Roman times when it was a part of the staple diet of soldiers at war. Roman authors, including Varro, Pliny the Elder, Hippocrates and Columella have mentioned about the cheese & its production technique, in their works. Even today, the cheese is made using only traditional methods in the unique areas of origin. Dry-salted by hand, the wheels get a salting numerous times, to deliver a fabulous taste. Its lengthy aging time from eight to 12 months results in a dry and granular texture and a strong taste. When young, the cheese has a soft and rubbery texture with sweet and aromatic flavour. The flavour becomes sharper and smokier when aged for eight months or longer.\r\n         \n\n\r\n           Pecorino Romano is one of most widely used, sharper alternatives to Parmesan cheeses. Because of the hard texture and sharp & salty flavour, Pecorino Romano is an excellent grating cheese over pasta dishes, breads and baking casseroles. Although, the use of the cheese is limited because of its extreme saltiness. Pair it with a glass of big, bold Italian red wine or a light beer.",

Quartirolo Lombardo is ripened between 5 to 30 days for soft PDO Quartirolo Lombardo and more than 30 days for Ripe PDO Quartirolo Lombardo.

Thirteenth century fables tell of Savoie herdsmen who carried out an incomplete milking of the cows in order to reduce their \u2018taxable\u2019 production of milk. After the rent was paid to the landowners, they went back to \u2018remilk' (reblocher) the cows.

The colour indicates that the milk used has a high cream content. Today, only a a couple of farms in Leicestershire makes the cheese using traditional methods and raw milk.\r\n         \n\r\n          Red Leicester is a hard cheese, similar to Cheddar but much more moist, crumblier with a milder flavour. It matures faster than cheddar and can be sold as young as two months. A good Leicester cheese can be identified by a firm body and a close, flaky texture. Though the cheese can be consumed young, to reach it's optimum flavour, it should be allowed to mature for six to nine months. A good cheese tastes slightly sweet with an almost caramel flavour and builds up a more robust taste as it ages.

Made since the 1\r\n          \r\n           st\r\n          \r\n          century B.C., there are several types of Romano cheese. Determined by the type of milk used, name of Romano cheeses may be preceded by the word Vaccino (cow\u2019s milk), Pecorino (sheep\u2019s milk) or Caprino (goat\u2019s milk). The most famous example of Romano cheese is\r\n          \r\n           Pecorino Romano\r\n          \r\n          , an exclusive Italian cheese with DOP designation from the Italian government.\r\n         \n\r\n          One of the most popular Italian cheeses, Romano cheese is made from pasteurised or unpasteurised milk using animal, plant, or microbial rennet. It has a grainy texture, a hard and brittle rind and grates easily. The curing of Romano takes not less than 5 months and longer if it is planned for grating.\r\n         \n\r\n          Every Romano cheese has its own peculiarities and shows different shades in texture, flavour and cooking uses. While Pecorino Romano, made from sheep\u2019s milk, is sharp and quite tangy the second type of Romano cheese, Caprino Romano made from goat\u2019s milk has an extremely sharp taste. The third variety made from cow\u2019s milk, Vacchino Romano, is very mild in flavour.\r\n         \n\r\n          Romano cheese works excellent as a table cheese. It can be grated over pasta, soups and salad or shaved onto cooked dishes and cream sauces. Hard cheeses like Romano best pair with fruity wines like Riesling and Prosecco.",

It takes extremely long time for the cheese to mature, a minimum of 18 months before it can be savored. The longer the cheese is matured, the more aromatic and spicy it tastes. It can be eaten in three different ways, depending on the age of cheese. At 18 months Sbrinz can be sliced or shaved into rolls. At the age of 24 months or even longer, Sbrinz develops its full flavour and is served as an aperitif or broken up into pieces (\u201cM\u00f6ckli\u201d) on a cheeseboard.

At the end of the cheese making process, which is akin to Mozzarella, the cheeses are hanged together in strings to ripen for about two weeks. The process of ripening the cheese has given Scamorza its name, which in southern Italy means \u2018beheaded\u2019.\r\n         \n\r\n          After two weeks of ripening, the cheese is sold as it is or smoked. The smoked variant, called \u2018Scamorzi Affumicate\u2019 is made by smoking the cheese over flaming straw for around 10 to 15 minutes. A fresh version of Scamorza is also sold within a few days of production.\r\n         \n\r\n          The texture of Scamorza is elastic, stringy and has less moisture than Mozzarella.

To make spicy Shanklish, spices such as aniseed and chilli is mixed in before the cheese is rolled into balls.\r\n          \n\r\n          Fresh Shanklish tastes mild with a soft texture, while those dried and aged for longer periods are darker and pungent in odour and flavour.

The area where it is produced is also a German speaking region and so the cheese also carries the name Stilfser. The cheese is aged for approximately 60 days, developing a semi-soft texture that is elastic. It has a reddish colored rind, and ivory colored pate with an uneven scattering of holes.

        "summary": "Vacherin Fribourgeois AOC is a Swiss semi-soft cheese made with raw cow\u2019s milk in the towns of Bulle (Canton Vaud) and Fribourg (Canton Fribourg in west-central Switzerland). This cheese is also made in other parts of Switzerland including the Jura Mountains on the border of France.\r\n         \n\r\n          The milk for the cheese is sourced from Fribourgeois breed of cows that graze on the Alpine grass and wild flowers all the way through the late spring and summer. As early fall arrives, the cows are brought down to graze on grass and summer hay. No other fodder is given to the cows except the Alpine meadows.\r\n         \n\r\n          This traditional cheese making process ensures that Vacherin Fribourgeois has a pleasant nutty flavour underpinned by notes of fresh hay and milk. Vacherin has an unpalatable natural and brushed washed rind with a stinky aroma, but it does not overpower the lovely smell of the cheese. The interior of the cheese is straw coloured with an open and buttery texture.\r\n         \n\r\n          Today Vacherin Fribourgeois is produced only by a small number of artisanal cheese makers and hence is very difficult to find. It has a Swiss AOC status with 6 varieties available: Classic (aged 6-12 weeks), Extra (aged minimum 12 weeks), Rustic (aged minimum 12 weeks, but up to 25 weeks (6 months)), Alpage (aged 12\u201325 weeks), Mountain (aged 9\u201325 weeks) and Organic (aged minimum 9 weeks).\r\n         \n\r\n          Vacherin Fribourgeois is used in fondues, cooking and as a table cheese. It is a great melting cheese, so try it on grilled sandwiches, potatoes or over steamed vegetables. Big and bold Burgundy\u2019s, Bordeaux or reds from the Rhone Valley in France will compliment the cheese well.",

Cheese produced only in the provinces of Parma, Reggio Emilia, Modena, and Bologna to the west of the Reno River and Mantua to the east of the Po River is assigned the D.O.P tag.\r\n         \n\r\n          With its rich, nutty taste and distinctive aroma, it is used by the finest chefs in food preparation. But it is equally delicious to eat with fruit, crackers and wine or sprinkled on pasta, rice or soup.\r\n          \n\r\n          Traditional production follows an 800-year old tradition of not using additives and feeding the cows on a special diet containing no silage. Parmigiano Reggiano, an Italian cow's milk cheese would be easily recognized for another reason - the wheel is enormous, approx. 75 pounds. Controlled by Consorzio Parmigiano-Reggiano, a quasi-governmental/trade group, the cheese is aged a minimum of 18-months to 3 years. It carries a mark on the cheese. Look for the Zanetti mark to ensure you are buying the best.\r\n          \n\r\n          The traditional flavour profile is described as nutty and the long aging produces white calcium spots which give the cheese a crunchy bite.\r\n          \n\r\n          Parmigiano-Reggiano is used in cooking in various ways. Grate, shred or shave it on pasta, salads, vegetables or fruits. The cheese is high in calcium, and low in fat and hence very healthy.\r\n          \n\r\n          Parmigiano Reggiano cheese is available in two ripening stages.\r\n          \r\n          If ripened for 18 months then the taste is sharp and nutty.\r\n          \r\n          If ripened for 2 - 3 years then the taste is pure, sharp and nutty.",
